# NextPat
Human-AI Collaboration for Design Ideation and Patent Drafting

NextPat is an intelligent system built upon the Human-AI Co-creation (HAIC) theoretical model. It bridges the gap between raw innovative inspiration and rigorous legal documentation, specifically designed for Patent-Oriented Inventive Design (POID).

The system is currently deployed and operational on ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China.

#✨ Key Features
Theory-Driven Ideation: Integrates TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) with Generative AI to overcome "ideation fixation" and generate breakthrough technical solutions.

Dual-Drive Architecture: Combines Heuristic Reasoning (for logical problem solving) and Structured Generation (for drafting).

Multi-Agent Collaboration: Employs specialized AI agents to transform technical concepts into high-quality, legally-compliant patent drafts.

Industrial Strength: Validated in the field of information systems and actively used by researchers to accelerate the R&D-to-IP lifecycle.
