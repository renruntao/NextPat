# NextPat
Human-AI Collaboration for Design Ideation and Patent Drafting

NextPat is an intelligent system built upon the Human-AI Co-creation (HAIC) theoretical model. It bridges the gap between raw innovative inspiration and rigorous legal documentation, specifically designed for Patent-Oriented Inventive Design (POID).

The system is currently deployed and operational on ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China.

## 💡 Overview
﻿
NextPat integrates a dual-drive approach based on **heuristic reasoning** and **structured generation** to address two major challenges in patenting:
1. **Ideation Stage:** Deep integration of **TRIZ** (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) and **GenAI** to solve the lack of innovative inspiration.
2. **Draftingn Stage:** Multi-agent collaboration driven by **prompt engineering** to transform technical solutions into formal legal texts.

## 🚀 Key Features
﻿
- **Theory-Driven:** Uses TRIZ heuristics to push AI beyond incremental improvements toward breakthrough innovation.
- **Collaborative Workflow:** Implements the **HAIC model** (Human, AI, Creation, Interaction, Instructions).
- **Multi-Agent System:** Specialized agents for technical analysis, claim drafting, and legal verification.
- **Proven Efficacy:** Experimental results show significant advantages in innovation dimension and output efficiency compared to human-only or AI-only schemes.
